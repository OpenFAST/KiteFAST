Modeling Considerations
=======================


KiteAeroDyn was designed as an extremely flexible tool for modeling a
wide-range of aerodynamic conditions and kite configurations. This
section provides some general guidance to help you construct models that
are compatible with KiteAeroDyn.


Standalone KiteKiteAeroDyn Driver
---------------------------------

The standalone KiteKiteAeroDyn driver code is very useful for computing kite
aerodynamics independent of aero-elastic coupling. The standalone
KiteKiteAeroDyn driver code generates a time-series of flight 
kinematics and control signals (the inputs to the aerodynamic calculations).
The full suite of KiteAeroDyn output channels are available for these simulations.


Environmental Conditions
------------------------

For air, typical values for ``AirDens``, ``KinVisc``,
``SpdSound``, and ``Patm`` are around 1.225 kg/m\ :sup:`3`, 1.460E-5
m\ :sup:`2`/s, 340.3 m/s, and 101,325 Pa, respectively. 


Lifting Line Vortex-step Method
-------------------------------

We recommend initially setting ``VSMToler``, ``VSMMaxIter``, and ``VSMPerturb`` to ``DEFAULT``.
If this simulation issues errors regarding convergence of the VSM solution, then you may need to
alter these default values.  First, try increasing the value of ``VSMMaxIter`` beyond the default 
value of 40.  Then you may need to turn either or both of the ``VSMToler`` or ``VSMPerturb`` values.


Temporal and Spatial Discretization
-----------------------------------

For accuracy and numerical stability, we recommend that ``DTAero`` be
set to 0.01 seconds.

For the kite aerodynamic surfaces spatial discretization, using higher number of
analysis nodes will result in a more accurate solution at the expense of
longer computational time. We recommend a node spacing of roughly 1 meters.  The 
vortex step method theory is not meant for discretizations finer than this. 
When KiteAeroDyn is coupled to MBDyn, the aerodynamic surfaces 
analysis node discretization may be independent from the
discretization of the nodes in the structural module.


Pylon and Rotor Ordering
------------------------

The pylon node list must be structured such that all starboard pylon nodes appear first, 
starting with the inner-most pylon and ending with the outer-most pylon. Then the port pylon 
nodes are listed, again starting with the inner-most pylon and ending with the outer-most pylon.

The node list must be structured such that all starboard pylon rotors appear first, starting with the inner-most pylon and 
ending with the outer-most pylon. Then the port pylon rotors are listed, again starting with the inner-most pylon 
and ending with the outer-most pylon. Each pylon must contain a line for the top rotor followed by the bottom rotor.
The table will contain a total of four times ``NumPylons`` lines.


Units of the User-supplied Control Settings
-------------------------------------------

The units used for the ``Ctrl`` values in the multi-dimensional airfoil tables
must match the units of the control signals generated by the user-supplied 
KiteFast controller.
